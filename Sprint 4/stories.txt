The walls are damp and echo with distant whispers.
A rusty chandelier swings slowly from the ceiling.
You feel a chill as you enter — something watched you.
Cobwebs cling to the corners like forgotten memories.
Ashes scatter across the floor, hinting at a burned past.
Scratched messages line the walls: "Turn back!"
A foul stench clings to the air in this chamber.
A single torch flickers, illuminating old bloodstains.
You hear chains rattling — but see no one.
The silence here is heavier than the stone around you.
The floorboards groan beneath your feet, as if warning you to leave.
A cold draft slithers through the room, carrying the scent of decay.
Shadows twist unnaturally, forming shapes that vanish when you look too close.
A child's laughter echoes faintly—but there are no children here.
The air hums with a low, unsettling vibration, like a buried heartbeat.
Dust motes swirl in the dim light, as if disturbed by unseen movement.
A single drop of water falls in steady rhythm, like a ticking clock.
Your breath fogs in the air, though the cold feels unnatural.
Something skitters in the darkness—too large to be a rat.
The walls seem to breathe, pulsing faintly in the flickering torchlight.
A portrait's eyes follow you, its painted smile now a grimace.
Footsteps echo behind you, but when you turn, nothing is there.
A whisper curls into your ear—just your name, then silence.
The door creaks shut on its own, though no wind stirs.
A broken mirror reflects a figure standing behind you—but you're alone.
A book lies open on a table, its pages filled with frantic scribbles.
The flame of your torch burns green for a moment before returning to normal.
A handprint, fresh and wet, stains the wall—but whose?
The temperature drops suddenly, your skin prickling with unseen eyes.
A distant scream cuts through the silence—then is swallowed by the dark.
